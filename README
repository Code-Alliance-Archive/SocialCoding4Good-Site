Setting up your Drupal environment:

Create a mysql database, user, and password.  The database will be called sc4g_site, the user will be called sc4g_user, and you should make your own password where you see [db_pass]:
  mysqladmin -u root -p create sc4g_site
  mysql -u root -p
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE
  TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES 
  ON sc4g_site.*
  TO 'sc4g_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '[db_pass]';

Install Drush:
  sudo apt-get install drush

Run the following, replacing [db_pass] with the password from above and [server_user] with your server's user (usually www-data on apache2):
  drush dl drupal --drupal-project-rename=sc4g-site
  cd sc4g-site
  drush site-install standard --db-url=mysql://sc4g_user:[db_pass]@localhost/sc4g_site --site-name="Social Coding 4 Good"
  sudo chown -R [server_user] sites/default/files

If your server can't use clean URLs, run the following command:
  drush vset clean_url 0 --yes
